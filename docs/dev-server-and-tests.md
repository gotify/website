## Start development servers

### Backend

Start the server in development mode.

```bash
$ go run .
```

### UI

Start the UI development server.

_Commands must be executed inside the ui directory._

```bash
$ npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` inside your favorite browser.

The UI requires a Gotify server running on `localhost:80`. This can be adjusted inside
[ui/src/index.tsx](https://github.com/gotify/server/blob/master/ui/src/index.tsx).

## Update Swagger spec

The [gotify/server REST-API](swagger-docs.md) is documented via Swagger. The Swagger definition is generated via source code comments
([example comment](https://github.com/gotify/server/blob/09c1516a170dfb47d29644db622655b540b94922/api/application.go#L33)).

After changing such a source code comment, you can run the following command to update the Swagger definition.

```bash
$ make update-swagger
```

## Tests

### Execute Backend Tests

#### Run tests with parallelism

```bash
$ go test ./...
```

#### Run Tests with Coverage

```bash
$ make test-coverage
$ go tool cover -html=coverage.txt # get a HTML coverage report
```

#### Run Tests with Race Detector

```bash
$ make test-race
```

### Execute UI (end2end) Tests

Build the ui because the end2end test should be run against the production build.
(This needs to be done on every change in the UI)

```bash
$ (cd ui && npm run build)
```

Now execute the tests with npm

```bash
$ (cd ui && npm run test)
```

### Execute Static Checks

The following command checks the formatting and executes some linters like tslint and govet.

```bash
$ make check
```
